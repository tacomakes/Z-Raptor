## 10/24/2025 - Redesigned the X axis extrusions!  

I did all of this before I learned about #blueprint, but I am happy to be submitting it!
Although it looks finished, it is definitely not. I started with a simple model by Sergei Irbis on printables here:
https://www.printables.com/model/1174545-duender-2x-creality-ender-3-corexy-convertion

I thought it was a good idea, so I started with the simplest parts. I then made it compatible with the Ender 3 PRO, improved the Z-axis (which would require a CNC machine), added a Sprite extruder, which I had on my old Ender 3 PRO, relocated the PSU, changed the belt system, and added more hardware, including screws and bearings. ![Screenshot 2025-10-24 141205](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTE5MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e0e7126b2885f79c7b3b48023e331ca1e090771d/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20141205.png)
Besides the original model being extensive, I plan on making a better Z-axis system that will be able to utilize a Heim junction.
I plan on making it much more in the future!ðŸ¤”ðŸš€âœ¨
